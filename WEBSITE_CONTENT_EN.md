### Boundaries

**Section Title:** What We Do Not Do

We believe clarity about scope prevents misaligned expectations.

- **No Implementation**
  We do not execute projects, write code, or manage deployments. We advise; your team or vendors implement.

- **No Managed Services**
  We do not provide ongoing IT support, monitoring, or operations. Our role ends with the delivery of advisory deliverables.

- **No Product Sales**
  We do not sell, resell, or distribute technology products. We have no inventory, no licenses to move, no commissions to earn.

- **No Guaranteed Outcomes**
  Technology decisions involve inherent uncertainty. We provide informed guidance, not promises of specific business results.

**Statement:**
Our independence is our value. We succeed when you make an informed decision—regardless of which option you choose.

**Headline:** Client Engagements

**Subheadline:**
Examples of how we've helped organizations make informed technology decisions. Details anonymized to protect client confidentiality.

---

### Case Study 1: Cloud Migration Strategy for Regional Bank

**Industry:** Financial Services
**Region:** GCC
**Engagement:** 6 weeks

**Situation:**
A regional bank with operations across three GCC countries needed to modernize its core infrastructure. The technology team favored a full cloud migration, while risk and compliance raised concerns about data sovereignty and regulatory requirements.

**Decision Required:**
Determine the appropriate infrastructure approach: full cloud migration, hybrid architecture, or modernized on-premise with cloud-native applications.

**Our Approach:**
- Conducted stakeholder interviews across technology, risk, compliance, and business units
- Mapped regulatory requirements across all operating jurisdictions
- Evaluated three cloud providers plus regional data center options
- Developed three architecture options with distinct trade-offs
- Analyzed total cost of ownership over 5-year horizon

**Options Presented:**

*Option A: Full Public Cloud*
Lower capital expenditure, faster deployment, but required regulatory approvals and data residency solutions.

*Option B: Hybrid Architecture*
Core banking on-premise, customer-facing applications in cloud. Balanced approach with moderate complexity.

*Option C: Modernized Private Cloud*
On-premise infrastructure with cloud-native technologies. Highest control, highest capital requirement.

**Outcome:**
The bank selected Option B (Hybrid Architecture) based on the trade-off analysis. Our recommendation aligned with this choice due to regulatory constraints and the bank's risk tolerance. The bank engaged a systems integrator for implementation using our requirements documentation and vendor evaluation framework.

**Deliverables Provided:**
- Infrastructure options analysis (47 pages)
- Regulatory requirements matrix
- Vendor evaluation scorecard
- Implementation sequencing recommendations
- Risk register with mitigation strategies

### Case Study 2: ERP Platform Selection for Manufacturing Group

**Industry:** Manufacturing
**Region:** Saudi Arabia
**Engagement:** 4 weeks

**Situation:**
A manufacturing group operating five facilities was running disparate legacy systems across sites. Leadership approved an ERP consolidation initiative but faced conflicting vendor recommendations from different stakeholders.

**Decision Required:**
Select an ERP platform and implementation approach from three shortlisted vendors, considering Saudi localization requirements and Vision 2030 compliance.

**Our Approach:**
- Documented business requirements across all five facilities
- Evaluated shortlisted vendors against 86 functional and technical criteria
- Assessed Saudi localization capabilities including Zakat, VAT, and Arabic language support
- Conducted reference checks with regional implementations
- Analyzed implementation approaches and timeline options

**Options Presented:**

*Vendor A: Global Leader*
Most comprehensive functionality, highest cost, longest implementation timeline, limited local support.

*Vendor B: Regional Strong*
Strong Saudi presence, good localization, moderate functionality, competitive pricing.

*Vendor C: Cloud-Native*
Modern architecture, fastest deployment, but required process changes to fit standard workflows.

**Outcome:**
The manufacturing group selected Vendor B based on the combination of Saudi localization strength, regional support presence, and acceptable functionality coverage. Our trade-off analysis highlighted that Vendor A's additional features did not justify the cost premium for this client's requirements.

**Deliverables Provided:**
- Vendor evaluation matrix (86 criteria)
- Functional gap analysis
- Reference check summary
- Implementation approach comparison
- Contract negotiation considerations

## PAGE: ABOUT

### Hero

**Headline:** About NeoTechnology Solutions

**Subheadline:**
Independent technology advisory for organizations making important decisions. We provide clarity, structure, and objectivity.

---

### Our Approach

**Section Title:** Why Advisory Only

Traditional consultants often have conflicts of interest. They may recommend approaches that lead to implementation work. Vendors naturally advocate for their products. Internal teams may have organizational biases.

We removed these conflicts.

**We don't implement.** We have no incentive to recommend complex solutions that require extended projects.

**We don't sell products.** We have no inventory, no licenses, no commissions.

**We don't provide managed services.** We have no recurring revenue dependent on ongoing relationships.

**Our only product is clarity.** We succeed when you make an informed decision—regardless of which option you choose.

---

### Our Values

**Independence**
We maintain strict separation from vendors and implementation providers. Our recommendations are based solely on your requirements and our analysis.

**Structure**
We deliver documented frameworks, not verbal opinions. Every recommendation is traceable to evidence and requirements.

**Transparency**
We state our limitations upfront. We disclose any potential conflicts. We acknowledge uncertainty where it exists.

**Integrity**
We provide the advice we believe is right, even when it's not what clients want to hear. We decline engagements where we cannot add value.

**Clarity**
We translate complex technology decisions into understandable terms. Trade-offs are explained in business language.
